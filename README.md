Shows the "temperature" of your Notes in Obsidian's iconic Graph View! 

Read my Forum Post: [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2021-daily-progress-and-learnings/24472/7#hot-notes-1)

So what does this do? It shows your Notes in different colors depending on their temperature. What is the "temperature" of a note? Its how often you look at or edit it. Notes that you don't touch often get cold, while notes you read or edit often are still hot. 

## Caveats

It is super hacky and not very reliableâ€¦ The Plugin keeps track of how often you open a Note and assigns Tags based on that:

This also means it looks bad when Tags are shown in the Graph:
